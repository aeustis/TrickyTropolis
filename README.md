# TrickyTropolis
This is strategy card game, similar in certain ways to Magic: the Gathering or Hearthstone, but with a completely different emphasis: the game consists of single player puzzles rather than two player duels.  This cerebral game will challenge you to find creative ways to optimize the cards at your disposal.  Using a combination of logic, pattern recognition, and trial and error, you eventually prevail by reaching the required goal for the puzzle.

This project was created with Unity (https://unity3d.com/).  The TrickyTropolis subfolder can be opened as a Unity project.

To view the C# scripts that make this project work, you can take a look at the TrickyTropolis/Assets/code folder.  However, these scripts are attached to game objects in Unity so they do not define the scene itself.
